# Rock-paper-scrissors

The main purpose of this project is to create a game of rock-paper-scrissors where a human operator plays against the computer.
The rules of the games are simple. Rock beats scrissors, scrissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
The first one to get to 5 won rounds wins the game.
Let the games begin!
